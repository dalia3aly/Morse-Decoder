# Morse Code Translator

## Introduction

This project is a web-based Morse Code Translator that allows users to encode and decode Morse code messages to and from English letters. It features a simple and intuitive user interface for easy interaction with the core functionalities: encoding English text to Morse code, decoding Morse code to English, and copying the encoded or decoded messages to the clipboard.

## Features

- **Encode Text:** Users can input English text to be translated into Morse code in real-time.
- **Decode Morse:** Users can input Morse code (using dots `.` and dashes `-`) to be translated back to English text.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** With a single click, users can copy the encoded or decoded output to their clipboard for easy sharing and use.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Libraries:** SweetAlert2 for enhanced user alerts and confirmations.
- **Tools:** Git for version control, Jest for unit testing.

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start using the Morse code translator.
3. To run tests, ensure you have Node.js installed, then run `npm install` followed by `npm test`.


## Future Improvements

- **Audio Playback:** A planned enhancement is the addition of audio playback functionality. This will allow users to hear the Morse code output after encoding their input text. We aim to integrate an API that can generate audio for Morse code to make learning and understanding Morse code more interactive and accessible.
